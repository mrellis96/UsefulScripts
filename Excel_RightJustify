The following formulas will allow quick conversion of your data to a form that Text-to-Columns will readily parse right-justified as you describe:

Excel snip

D5 formula (appends a semicolon if absent):

=IF(RIGHT(B5,1)<>";",B5&";",B5)
G5 formula (prepends necessary number of semicolons):

=REPT(";",5-(LEN(D5)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(D5,";",""))))&D5
Copying the results followed by a Paste-Special-as-Values should afford raw material suitable for a Text-to-Columns conversion.

The solution depends on there being a fixed maximum number of columns; here, five. The formula of G5 could be generalized by adding a 'number of columns to generate' cell elsewhere on the sheet and referencing this new cell instead of the hard-coded 5 value.

Additionally, if you are guaranteed that the data will always have the trailing semicolon, the intermediate step of D5:D7 is superfluous.
